    "* **Supervised** learning models (labeled data). In such models the outcome is known so we continuously refine the model itself until our output reaches the desired accuracy level. An example is the **linear regression** model\n",
    "* If the outcome is unknown and we need classification to be done then the second category, **unsupervised learning** (unlabeled data), is used. Examples of unsupervised learning include **K-means** and **Apriori** algorithm.\n",

If this is successful, then we proceed to improve on the positive results achieved during the evaluation step or/and we may consider a different algorithm. Once we are happy, we proceed to the prediction step and derive insights."
